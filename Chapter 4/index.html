      <h2>who am I?</h2>
      <p> I was a child who was always fascinated by stories, who lived in his own world and weaved beautiful stories. But as a responsible teenager, I have to leave this child far behind and focus on the mundane routine of life.
 I can never be vocal about my emotions to most because no one gets it. <strong><em>"Haan ek tha jo kehta tha ki main special hoon. Bachpan. Mera Bachpan. Par uska toh gala kab ka dabaa diya"</em></strong> </p>

        <h3>Rockstar</h3>
        <p>Rockstar is a unique film, it deserves to be called a masterpiece. The movie takes you to an unbelievable journey, full of beauty, pain, sorrow, love, passion and heartbreak. It perfectly shows how the things we want the most in this life
          won’t actually make us happy, how strange falling in love is and how it changes a soul, how money and fame can’t turn off the fire burning inside. It’s perfectly written, strong and emotional acting with great background score, and one of
          the best albums ever released. Rockstar is a timeless movie, and that’s what true art delivers. Definitely a must watch for the lover’s soul, and people who have good taste in film.</p>

        <h3>Tamasha</h3>
        <p>There's no reason why this movie cant be claimed as a masterpiece..the reason bieng that we as viewers are not subjected to this kind of real cinema where the movie makes a perfect balance between cinamtic experience and character a driven
          story.
          Portrayel of such characters are raely nurtured at the very first viewing because it shows a mirror to the society and makes full justice to it.
          If there's any movie that has always inspired me as a person is tamasha..i have no words to describe how i and many of my kind of people can connect to this story.
          Also technically..this movie is outstanding..music , lyrics , cinematography, production everything.
          Imtiaz , Ranbir n deepika have given this gem to indian cinema..a huge thanks to them.</p>

        <h3>Highway</h3>
        <p>I don't actually find words to describe how deeply this movie has made a mark in my heart and soul. The characters were so real and terrific that they made me cry and smile at the same time. Watched one of the best movies that bollywood
          ever made. I wish this movie never ended.Hats off to everyone who made this beautiful, realistic, heartbreaking piece of art. And I gurantee You that, you will feel the real you hidden within yourself after you watch this movie. So what are
          you waiting for?</p>

        <h3>Love Aaj Kal</h3>
        <p>"jo mein hu aur jo mein ban na cahata tha wo dono alag alag log hai"
          Most of the people have given low rating to this movie as they have compared it to the last one which was also a gem.
          This one is far more better then that one for sure.
          It narrates two different stories - one from the 90's and other one from 2020. While in the old one boy leaves everything and everyone for his love(not practical at all) but ultimately life takes his usual course and its too late before he
          finally realized what he has lost.
          On the hand is a young and dynamic career focused girl who wants to focus on her career only.. being practical but yes life as we say it takes the usually ups and downs and leaves her in a situation where she needs to decide between her
          career and love.
          The connection between both these stories have been so beautifully crafted.</p>

        <h3>Jab We Met</h3>
        <p>The little moments that Imtiaz Ali came up with throughout the movie had a sparkling effect. The moment when Geet asks Aditya if she finds him cute playfully was really subtle but lovely. Aditya's light and casual talks with Geet kept us smiling throughout the film. I feel Imtiaz stretched it a bit at the last, but overall it was an amazing watch. And how can one forget to mention those amazing songs. That dance in the rain has my heart. Beautiful movie.</p>
